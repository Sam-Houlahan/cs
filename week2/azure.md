# Deployment with Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud hosting service. It's a staple for many .NET shops, and is [growing rapidly](http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/19/microsoft-reports-22-6-billion-in-q4-2016-revenue-965-million-from-surface/). To get you started, check out [Deploy an ASP.NET web app to Azure App Service, using Visual Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/web-sites-dotnet-get-started/). There's also a lot of videos on various subjects: try [Create a Web App with ASP.NET and Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/videos/create-a-web-app-with-aspnet-and-azure-app-service/).
