# Deployment

Let's try to get this thing world-visible. Right click on the `Portfolio` project and choose _Publish..._, then choose _Microsoft Azure App Service_. You'll see a dialog like this one:

Note that you won't see "DreamSpark" as the subscription plan (that's something that doesn't really exist anymore, they rebranded it as "Microsoft Imagine") but they do have a similar free tier and if you've already signed up for Visual Studio Dev Essentials previously in Phase 4 to get the Pluralsight subscription, you will also have gotten some free Azure credits.

It's worth noting that you should be very careful not to accidentally get charged for using Azure! It is possible to do this entire module without paying any money. You should always be working from a free tier/free credits plan.

You will probably need to create a new resource group and app service plan. Choose locations close to you (Southeast Australia, for example). When you submit these details, you'll see a dialog like this one:
