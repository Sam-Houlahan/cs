# MVC Basics

1. Watch _The Basics of MVC and the Moving Parts_ in [https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322](Introduction to ASP.NET MVC).

  * ASP.NET provides two different approaches to building web applications: Webforms and MVC. Webforms came first and is still available today. MVC came later and is considered by most to be the better choice for new applications. The speakers in this video sometimes use Webforms as a way to describe how MVC is different but you do _not_ need to understand Webforms to understand MVC.

2. Watch _Creating and Configuring Models_ and _The Power of Visual Studio_ in [https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322](Introduction to ASP.NET MVC).

  * This video mentions Entity Framework "code first". These concepts will be covered in much more depth in a later video, but for now, don't worry too much about the different ways to use EF, of which, code first is one. As you can tell, there is a relationship between your models and EF. That's all you really need to know at this point.
  * The video on VS mentions Zen Coding. This approach to HTML development is now called Emmet.

3. Watch _Customizing Controllers_ in [https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322](Introduction to ASP.NET MVC).

4. Watch _Customizing Views_ in [https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322](Introduction to ASP.NET MVC).


## [The exercise]

Using Visual Studio 2015, create a new ASP.NET MVC application. Select the MVC template and build a build a clone of Twitter. The web app should let the user see a list of all tweets if they aren't signed in, but let them submit a new tweet if they are. You aren't expected to finish this application today, but you should be able to create some models, views and controllers to get started. Tomorrow we'll explore authentication.
