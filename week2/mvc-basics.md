# MVC Basics

1. Watch _The Basics of MVC and the Moving Parts_ in [Introduction to ASP.NET MVC](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322).

  * ASP.NET provides two different approaches to building web applications: Webforms and MVC. Webforms came first and is still available today. MVC came later and is considered by most to be the better choice for new applications. The speakers in this video sometimes use Webforms as a way to describe how MVC is different but you do _not_ need to understand Webforms to understand MVC.

2. Watch _Creating and Configuring Models_ and _The Power of Visual Studio_ in [Introduction to ASP.NET MVC](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322).

  * This video mentions Entity Framework Code First. These concepts will be covered in much more depth in a later video, but for now, don't worry too much about the different ways to use EF, of which, code first is one. As you can tell, there is a relationship between your models and EF. That's all you really need to know at this point.
  * The video on VS mentions Zen Coding. This approach to HTML development is now called Emmet.

3. Watch _Customizing Controllers_ in [Introduction to ASP.NET MVC](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322).

4. Watch _Customizing Views_ in [Introduction to ASP.NET MVC](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322).


## Portfolio: Scaffolding

We want you to come away from this week with something fairly complete rather than Yet Another Half-Finished Practice Piece (YAHFiPP). Something that will look good in your portfolio. There are a number of different concepts you might like to try, but our tutorials will walk you through a portfolio site: a framework for presenting past experience and current projects that you can use to show to employers at interviews.

Obviously you're going to want to put your own styling and personal touch on it, but we'll show you how to make it all work and how to test it all using xUnit.

To begin with, do the [scaffolding](portfolio/scaffolding.md) walkthrough.


## Getting Started

In addition to the above, you can get more practice or additional clarification from the [Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) series from Microsoft.

There's an important note here, however: the linked article suggests using a newer version of the tutorial featuring VS 2015 and ASP.NET Core MVC 6. While you should definitely use VS 2015, you should follow the tutorial linked, not the .NET Core version... at least while you're learning this curriculum. .NET 4.5 is in much more common use in the New Zealand market.
