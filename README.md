## Introduction

In Phase 4 we provide an introduction to various web technologies beyond the world of full-stack JavaScript. The content provided is for the most part curated from online sources. While you could certainly complete this yourself, we offer some structure, feedback, troubleshooting and code review. The phase will be conducted in similar style to Phase 0, with regular teacher contact each week.

This edition of Phase 4 provides an introduction to the Microsoft web ecosystem. Topics covered at an introductory level include:

 - The C# language
 - Unit testing with xUnit
 - Web development with ASP.NET MVC
 - Databases and the Entity Framework ORM
 - API provision with ASP.NET Web API

The expectation is that because you have graduated from EDA, you should now have a good understanding about how to go about learning new technologies. You know better than anyone what works best for you. Don't feel confined to the resources we reference here. You're in charge of your learning; we're just here to help however we can.

Have fun!


## Requirements

The expectation is that you have already completed the JavaScript bootcamp and therefore have some development experience under your belt before tackling the Phase 4 content. Trust us, you should have plenty to keep you going in Phases 1, 2, and 3 without adding to the load! (If you don't, ask your teachers for more... there's _always_ more.)


### Windows

While you can certainly write C# on other platforms, perhaps especially using the Mono compiler, most C# .NET development is done using Visual Studio on Windows and that's what we're going to familiarise you with... so you need access to a computer with Windows installed on it.

If you have a Windows laptop, great! Windows can also be run on a dual-boot with Linux (or Bootcamp on a Mac), or via a virtual machine on various platforms. What we probably can't help you with is a Windows license, which would mean you'd either have to own a Windows PC, be willing to buy Windows, or have access to someone who has the right kind of Microsoft Developer Network membership.

We may be able to help a (very) limited number of people with getting hold of a Windows install, but please exhaust all other available options first.
