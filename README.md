# Phase 4

In Phase 4 we provide an introduction to various web technologies beyond the world of full-stack JavaScript. The content provided is for the most part curated from online sources. While you could certainly complete this yourself, we offer some structure, feedback, troubleshooting and code review. The phase will be conducted in similar style to Phase 0, with regular teacher contact each week.
