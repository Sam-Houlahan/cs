Watch [Bending Time with Asynchronous C#](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=csharp-6-from-scratch&author=jesse-liberty&name=csharp-6-from-scratch-m11&clip=0&mode=live). The rest of that course could be useful as revision or extending your understanding of basic C# concepts: it can be found [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-6-from-scratch/table-of-contents).
