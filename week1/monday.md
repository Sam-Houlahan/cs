* Under "Installing Visual Studio" he recommends installing various things you don't actually need. For example, you don't need C++ or Python tools. All you need is the standard Windows and Web development tools, which chances are is the default setting.
* Most of this is _very_ entry-level! However, it does step you through gradually. You may find that you can work through this initial content quite quickly. Pro-tip: you can speed the video up to 1.5x or 2x if this is more comfortable for you (click on 'Normal speed' at the bottom right of the window).
* There are assessment quizzes associated with the content. We don't think these are terribly useful in helping you learn: we'd rather you spent time actually writing C#! Feel free to skip them.


You could take this content at different speeds. If you want to push further through the videos, feel free: but remember, always practice as you go! Just watching the videos will not make you fully understand the language: only actually working with the code yourself will do that.


## Write a game

One thing I quite like to do with a new language in the console is to write a text-based [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game: a simple game where the player, all the objects terrain are simple text characters. There's a surprising amount of complexity you can add, but you can also keep it extremely simple. There's a storied history of roguelikes stretching back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(video_game)">Hack</a>.

Of course, you can write whatever test/demo projects you like! However, each day this week we'll walk you through making a very simple console game using C#.
