# Best Practices

'Best' practices are tricky: sometimes they're a matter of personal opinion, sometimes there are wildly varying views on the subject, and often it's hard to know who to listen to when you're just starting out with a language.

## Spiral: Loading stuff

Let's see if we can add some File I/O here by [loading the game board](spiral/loading.md). When you're done with that, how about adding some [monsters](spiral/loading.md).

EDA does not hold an official opinion on the use of 'monsters', although we do suggest that instead of outright **slaying** you consider offering Actionable, Specific and Kind feedback._
