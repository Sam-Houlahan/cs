# Best Practices

'Best' practices are tricky: sometimes they're a matter of personal opinion, sometimes there are wildly varying views on the subject, and often it's hard to know who to listen to when you're just starting out with a language. Here's one attempt at [a C# guide from Deborah Kurata](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-best-practices-improving-basics/table-of-contents). There's quite a bit of content, so pick and choose if you like, or watch it start to finish. Some of it moves fairly slowly and represents things you hopefully already know ("unit tests are good!") but there is some good advice, and it covers some fundamentals.


## Exercises

As you go along, try to rewrite parts of your code from earlier in the week using the techniques described in the Pluralsight content. Think about what your code looks like to another developer. How easy is it to understand? Enlist someone else from the course or a teacher to conduct a brief code review.


## Spiral: Loading stuff

Let's see if we can add some File I/O here by [loading the game board](spiral/loading.md). When you're done with that, how about adding some [monsters](spiral/loading.md).

_Note that the term 'monsters' is considered perjorative by some. Consider using 'differently-genetic organisms', or 'creatures of the night'. EDA does not hold an official opinion on the use of 'monsters', although we do suggest that instead of outright **slaying** you consider offering Actionable, Specific and Kind feedback._
