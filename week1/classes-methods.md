# Classes and Methods

1. Watch sections 11 - 17 of [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169).
2. Optional: play the 'onboarding' level of [Coding Game](https://www.codingame.com/ide/5180739af6d7b3b0752f422ffc911f6f25dabd0) (make sure you choose C# as the language!)


## Exercises

Practice with classes, methods, and properties.

  1. Create your own class with an array property.
  2. Write methods for each of the CRUD operations, modifying the array.
  3. What do you have to change if you change the property's accessibility to `private`? Does it work the same if it's a [private field](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173118.aspx)?
  4. Try writing a simple console app that stores information in the array, for example cataloging a record collection.
    - Offer the user a text menu with options to create, view, update and delete records
    - Write a simple text search on album title
    - Write a simple search on album artist
    - Offer a random suggestion for what to listen to next

The last exercise gives you a chance to practice creating a few simple types (classes). You're likely to need an `Album` type and an `Artist` type at minimum.


## Spiral: the Board

Let's kick this off with a few tests that actually do something. Have a go at [creating the game board](spiral/board.md).
